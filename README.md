In order to enhance our visualization and provide geographical context to the data, we have decided to incorporate an additional dataset containing information about Indian cities, (see indian cities csv).

The inclusion of city-level data allows us to explore correlations between various features and geographic regions, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns in the dataset.
